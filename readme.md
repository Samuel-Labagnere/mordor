# Mordor

First week of the second year of Mast√®re Lead Developer Front End at the ECV.
Learning ThreeJS, we need to build a small website with 3D interactibles.

Focusing on LOTR and the Barad Dur here, the tower from the Evil Lord Sauron.

## TODO
- [x] Make the Eye follow the camera with some intended latency
(like you're escaping it and it won't allow you)
- [x] Hide the Eye at base and only show it when pressing a key, starting the music alongside
- [x] Code a rain shader for the postprocessing to add some ambiance
- [x] Continue on that path by adding thunder sounds that play randomly (with a minimum gap)
- [x] Add flash postprocessing effects with random position when the thunder plays
- [x] Add texts that appear on the screen from time to time
- [x] Make the light intensity from the Eye slowly itensify
- [x] Configure the CameraControls to avoid the user to clip through objects
- [x] Hint the user on how to make the Eye appear
- [ ] Add a funny screamer of Scary Bilbo when trying to look the Eye too close
