# Mordor

First week of the second year of Mast√®re Lead Developer Front End at the ECV.
Learning ThreeJS, we need to build a small website with 3D interactibles.

Focusing on LOTR and the Barad Dur here, the tower from the Evil Lord Sauron.

## TODO
1. Make the eye follow the camera with some intended latency
(like you're escaping it and it won't allow you)
2. Hide the eye at base and only show it when pressing a key, starting the music alongside
3. Code a rain shader for the postprocessing to add some ambiance
4. Continue on that path by adding thunder sounds that play randomly (with a minimum gap)
5. Add flash postprocessing effects with random position when the thunder plays
6. Add a funny screamer of Scary Bilbo when trying to look the eye too close
